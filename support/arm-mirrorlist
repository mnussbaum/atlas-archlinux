# Arch Rollback Machine (ARM) repository
#
# We can use this file as pacman's mirrorlist to see the packages at a given point in time. Since
# Arch Linux follows a rolling release cycle (there are no "releases"), it might be difficult to
# stick with a particular package's version due to compatibility issues etc. This helps with such
# issues.
